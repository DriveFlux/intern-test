## Internship Assessment

This is an assessment for the position of Intern Developer within Flux.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses `pnpm` and not `yarn` or `npm`. Please setup your `pnpm` environment by visiting [PNPM's website](https://pnpm.js.org/).

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Mission

The mission of this assessment is to convert the default frontend that Next.js is using from regular CSS to using ChakraUI.

You can check out Chakra UI's documentation [in their website](https://chakra-ui.com/).
## Things to take into consideration

There are no strict guidelines to how you will implement this, we would like you to have the freedom of structuring your folders and code. However, there are bonus points, these are not mandatory, but might help you outcompete the other candidates:

- Good folder structure
- Good components structure
- Keeping it very simple, yet extensible
- Typing of the components

## Submission

Please clone this repository and submit to your own repository of choice (Github, bitbucket, Gitlab, or any other options). Make sure to share the access with us.

There is no time boundaries, but of course, the sooner, the better points you'll get.

Good Luck,
Flux Team.
